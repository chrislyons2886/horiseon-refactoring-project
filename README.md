# horiseon-refactoring-project

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to help my client, Horiseon, make their website more accessible, fix bugs, and clean up their HTML and CSS files. I did not build this website, but instead it was a refacoring project I was contracted for.  I streamlined HTML and CSS code and added some structure along the way.  This fix solves a few problems: all nav links are functioning properly now; the HTML was updated with more descriptive, semantic elements that will make the code easier to read for people and machines by using elemnts for their given purpose; and I consolidated and reorganized the CSS sheet to make it flow better.
